      intro: 'I’m IXYZ, a front-end developer. I’m proficient in spelling terms like JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, React, and UniApp. To get straight to the point, I excel in Vue 3 and Vue 2 frameworks, along with their ecosystems, including Vuex, Pinia for state management, Vue Router, and UI component libraries. I’m also familiar with React and its related tools, UniApp for building mini-programs, Nuxt for SSR (server-side rendering), Nest for backend development, and Docker for containerized deployment.'
